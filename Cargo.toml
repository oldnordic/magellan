# Java bytecode library for CFG extraction (optional, for bytecode-cfg)
# Note: This is a placeholder for future ASM integration.
# The org.ow2.asm library is Java-based; Rust equivalents are being evaluated.
# Phase 44-02 will implement the actual bytecode CFG extraction.
# See docs/JAVA_BYTECODE_CFG.md for details.
