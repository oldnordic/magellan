# STATE: Magellan

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Produce correct, deterministic symbol + reference + call graph data from real codebases, continuously, without stopping on bad files.

**Product framing:** Local-first CLI indexer whose outputs are reliable enough to be treated as an API contract (schema-versioned, deterministic, span-aware, stable IDs).

## Current Position

- **Current phase:** Phase 1 — Persistence Compatibility Baseline
- **Status:** Planning complete (roadmap drafted)
- **Next action:** `/gsd:plan-phase 1`

**Progress bar:** [----------] 0% (v1 roadmap phases not yet executed)

## Success Definition (v1)

Magellan v1 is “done” when a user can:
- Run watch/index against a repo deterministically (baseline then incremental),
- Query defs/refs/callers/callees with span-aware stable IDs,
- Export graph data deterministically,
- Validate runs and correlate outputs/logs to an `execution_id`,
- Script all of the above via schema-versioned JSON without stdout contamination.

## Performance / Quality Metrics (track as work progresses)

- **Determinism:** Same command on unchanged inputs → byte-for-byte identical JSON (ignoring allowed fields).
- **Span fidelity:** Spans are UTF-8 byte offsets, half-open; line/col mapping consistent with editor display.
- **Watcher robustness:** Editor-save storms do not cause nondeterministic final DB state.
- **Reliability:** Per-file errors never crash watch; errors appear as structured diagnostics.

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions (from PROJECT.md)
- CLI-first tool; no server responsibilities.
- `--db <FILE>` required; no hidden state.
- Watch defaults to scan-initial then watch.
- Structured JSON + stable IDs + deterministic ordering as v1 contract.

### Known Risks / Watch-outs
- Mixed coordinate systems (byte vs char; inclusive vs exclusive).
- “Stable IDs” accidentally derived from unstable sources (rowid, node id, iteration order).
- Watch event storms creating nondeterministic intermediate states.

### Blockers
- None currently (roadmap created). If constraints change (e.g., interop export moved to v2), revisit Phase 9.

## Session Continuity

If resuming later, start by:
1. Open `.planning/ROADMAP.md` and confirm Phase 1 scope.
2. Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1`.
3. Keep a running log of determinism acceptance tests/golden fixtures as they’re introduced.
