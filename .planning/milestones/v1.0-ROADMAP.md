# Milestone v1.0: Magellan

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-19
**Phases:** 1-9
**Total Plans:** 29

## Overview

Magellan v1 is a deterministic, local-first codebase mapping CLI. The roadmap focuses on making Magellan's outputs and identifiers **contract-grade** (schema-versioned, span-aware, stable IDs) while keeping watch mode **reliable under real editor workloads**.

**Planning depth:** comprehensive (config.json)

---

## Phases

### Phase 1 — Persistence Compatibility Baseline

**Goal:** Users can run Magellan against a chosen SQLite DB with explicit compatibility guarantees.

**Dependencies:** None

**Requirements:** DB-01, DB-02

**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Pin sqlitegraph v1.0.0 (crates.io) + lockfile
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Add read-only preflight + two-phase CodeGraph open
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Add magellan_meta + tests for no partial mutation
- [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — Gap closure: align Phase 1 docs + verification report

**Success Criteria (observable):**
1. User can build/run Magellan with **sqlitegraph v1.0.0 pinned from crates.io**, with reproducible dependency resolution via committed `Cargo.lock` (no hidden drift).
2. When user passes `--db <FILE>`, Magellan records a schema version in the database.
3. When user opens an incompatible/older DB, Magellan refuses to proceed with a clear, deterministic error (and does not partially mutate the DB).

---

### Phase 2 — Deterministic Watch & Indexing Pipeline

**Goal:** Users can continuously index a repo via watch mode and trust it to behave deterministically under file event storms.

**Dependencies:** Phase 1

**Requirements:** WATCH-01, WATCH-02, WATCH-03, WATCH-04, WATCH-05A

**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Per-file reconcile + delete_file_facts (true idempotency; no ghost nodes)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Debounced batching + buffer events during scan-initial (storm determinism)
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Include/exclude rules + structured diagnostics (skip reasons + per-file errors)

**Success Criteria (observable):**
1. User runs `watch` and observes a complete **scan-initial baseline** before any incremental updates are applied.
2. When user saves a file repeatedly (editor storm), Magellan coalesces the events deterministically and produces the same resulting indexed state as a clean re-run.
3. User can apply ignore/include/exclude rules and can see which files were skipped and why via structured diagnostics.
4. User can re-index the same file multiple times and the DB reflects only the latest derived facts (no ghost nodes/edges).
5. When a file cannot be read/parsed, watch continues running and the failure is captured as structured diagnostics (with deterministic stderr output for human consumption).

---

### Phase 3 — CLI Output Contract (Schema + Determinism + Stdout Discipline)

**Goal:** Users can script Magellan reliably because every command has deterministic, schema-versioned JSON output with clean stdout/stderr separation.

**Dependencies:** Phase 2

**Requirements:** OUT-01, OUT-02, OUT-03, WATCH-05B

**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Output module foundation (JsonResponse, OutputFormat, execution_id, stdout/stderr helpers)
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — CLI --output flag + status command JSON output (proof of concept)
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Query/find/refs/files commands JSON output (span-aware results)

**Success Criteria (observable):**
1. For every user-facing command, user can request JSON output (or get JSON in machine mode) that includes `schema_version` and documented fields.
2. On unchanged inputs, running the same command twice produces JSON output with deterministic ordering (no HashMap-order drift).
3. Stdout contains only machine-consumable data; logs/diagnostics never contaminate stdout (they go to stderr).

---

### Phase 4 — Canonical Span Model + Span-Aware Results

**Goal:** Users can treat Magellan's "points into source code" as a consistent coordinate system across languages and files.

**Dependencies:** Phase 3

**Requirements:** ID-01, OUT-04

**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Implement SHA-256 based stable span ID generation
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Add comprehensive span model tests (determinism, UTF-8, half-open semantics)
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — Document the canonical span model in module docs

**Success Criteria (observable):**
1. Any result that points into source code includes byte offsets and line/col, with explicit range semantics (half-open) that are consistent across all commands.
2. For non-ASCII source files, user can still use returned byte ranges safely (no invalid UTF-8 slicing assumptions) and line/col mapping matches what editors display.
3. Users can compare spans across runs and see they refer to the same lexical region when the underlying file content is unchanged.

---

### Phase 5 — Stable Identity + Execution Tracking

**Goal:** Users can correlate runs and results across time using stable IDs and per-run `execution_id`.

**Dependencies:** Phase 4

**Requirements:** OUT-05, ID-02, ID-03, ID-04, DB-03

**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Add stable symbol_id generation (SymbolNode + SymbolFact schema)
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Create ExecutionLog module for run tracking
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md — Add symbol_id to JSON output (SymbolMatch + query propagation)
- [x] 05-04-PLAN.md — Wire execution tracking in all command handlers

**Success Criteria (observable):**
1. Every run produces an `execution_id` that appears in CLI JSON outputs and is recorded in the database.
2. For unchanged inputs, `span_id` values remain stable across repeated runs.
3. For unchanged inputs, `symbol_id` values remain stable across repeated runs.
4. Each result payload that represents a "match" includes stable identifiers (`match_id`, `span_id`, `symbol_id`) where applicable, allowing downstream tooling to de-duplicate and diff results.

---

### Phase 6 — Query UX (Definitions, References, Call Graph, File Listing)

**Goal:** Users can query the indexed graph from the CLI with deterministic, span-aware, ID-stable results.

**Dependencies:** Phase 5

**Requirements:** QRY-01, QRY-02, QRY-03, QRY-04

**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Fix find command symbol_id propagation (find by name sets None, should use symbol_id)
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Add target_symbol_id to references (ReferenceMatch lacks target ID)
- [x] 06-03-PLAN.md — Add symbol_id to call graph results (CallFact needs caller/callee IDs)
- [x] 06-04-PLAN.md — Create files command with --symbols flag (list indexed files)

**Success Criteria (observable):**
1. User can look up symbol definitions by name/kind and receive span-aware results with stable IDs.
2. User can look up references to a symbol and receive span-aware results with stable IDs.
3. User can query callers/callees and results are deterministically ordered and include stable IDs.
4. User can list symbols (and counts) for a given file/module.

---

### Phase 7 — Deterministic Exports (JSON/JSONL, DOT, CSV)

**Goal:** Users can export the graph into stable, diff-friendly formats for downstream tooling.

**Dependencies:** Phase 5

**Requirements:** EXP-01, EXP-02, EXP-03

**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — JSON/JSONL export with stable IDs and deterministic ordering
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — DOT (Graphviz) export for call graphs
- [x] 07-03-PLAN.md — CSV export for core entities (symbols, references, calls)

**Success Criteria (observable):**
1. User can export a full graph snapshot to JSON/JSONL with stable IDs and deterministic ordering.
2. User can export DOT (Graphviz) for caller->callee graphs and render it with standard Graphviz tooling.
3. User can export CSV for core entities/edges (symbols, references, calls) with stable IDs suitable for spreadsheets/pipelines.

---

### Phase 8 — Validation Hooks (Pre/Post) Surfaced via JSON

**Goal:** Users can verify indexing correctness and get actionable diagnostics when invariants fail.

**Dependencies:** Phases 2, 3, 5

**Requirements:** DB-04

**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Create validation module (ValidationReport, orphan detection)
- [x] 08-02-PLAN.md — Add ValidationResponse type for JSON output
- [x] 08-03-PLAN.md — Wire validation hooks into CLI (--validate, --validate-only)
- [x] 08-04-PLAN.md — Add validation module tests

**Success Criteria (observable):**
1. User can enable validation and receive a pre-run manifest/checksum summary and post-run invariant results in JSON output.
2. When a post-run invariant fails, Magellan exits non-zero and returns structured diagnostics that identify the failure class.
3. Validation results are tied to an `execution_id` so the user can correlate diagnostics to a specific run.

---

### Phase 9 — Interop Export (SCIP)

**Goal:** Users can emit interoperable index formats with documented encoding and identity rules.

**Dependencies:** Phases 4, 5, 7

**Requirements:** EXP-04

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 09-01-PLAN.md — Add SCIP export with protobuf binary output

**Success Criteria (observable):**
1. User can export to SCIP with documented position encoding (0-indexed lines, UTF-8 byte offsets) and symbol identity rules.
2. A standard SCIP consumer can parse the exported artifact without format errors.

**Note:** LSIF export is deferred to v2. LSIF is deprecated by Sourcegraph in favor of SCIP.

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None

**Key Decisions:**
- CLI-first tool for local developers — keeps scope tight; enables scripting + integration
- Use tree-sitter for AST fact extraction — cross-language parsing with deterministic syntax trees
- Persist facts in SQLite-backed graph (sqlitegraph) — portable, inspectable, queryable local store
- `--db` flag required for DB path selection — no hidden state; supports repeatable runs
- Watch does "scan initial + then watch" — v1 must produce a complete baseline before incremental updates
- Structured JSON output with stable IDs + span-aware fields — enables deterministic downstream tooling
- Deterministic ordering everywhere (sorted outputs) — diff-friendly, reproducible automation
- Validation hooks + execution logging with `execution_id` — verifiability + audit trail

**Issues Resolved:**
- Deterministic watch mode with debounced event batching
- Schema-versioned JSON output with stdout/stderr discipline
- Stable span and symbol IDs across runs
- SCIP export for Sourcegraph interoperability

**Issues Deferred:**
- Nested .gitignore file support (only root .gitignore loaded)
- Fully-qualified names (FQN) for symbols — using simple names in v1
- LSIF export (deprecated in favor of SCIP)
- Multi-root workspaces

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Symbol name collisions in `symbol_name_to_id` HashMap keeps first occurrence
- Legacy single-event Watcher API has deprecated methods
- Incomplete FQN (set to simple name instead of hierarchical)
- Full symbol scan for references on every file change
