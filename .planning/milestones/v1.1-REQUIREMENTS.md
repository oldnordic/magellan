# Requirements: Magellan v1.1

**Defined:** 2026-01-19
**Core Value:** Produce correct, deterministic symbol + reference + call graph data from real codebases, continuously, without stopping on bad files.

## v1.1 Requirements

### FQN Correctness

- [x] **FQN-01**: Extract fully-qualified names (FQN) during tree-sitter traversal for all indexed languages — ✅ Phase 11
- [x] **FQN-02**: Switch symbol lookup maps from simple name → symbol_id to FQN → symbol_id — ✅ Phase 11
- [x] **FQN-03**: Implement per-language scope tracking (Rust `::`, Python `.`, Java `.`) — ✅ Phase 11
- [x] **FQN-04**: symbol_id generation uses hash(language, FQN, span_id) - never simple names — ✅ Phase 11
- [x] **FQN-05**: Treat simple names as display-only for user-facing output — ✅ Phase 11
- [x] **FQN-06**: Emit warnings when FQN collisions are detected — ✅ Phase 11

### Path Traversal Security

- [x] **PATH-01**: Implement path canonicalization before validation for all file access — ✅ Phase 10
- [x] **PATH-02**: Create `validate_path_within_root()` function that rejects paths escaping project root — ✅ Phase 10
- [x] **PATH-03**: Add tests for traversal attempts (`../`, `..\\`, symlinks, UNC paths) — ✅ Phase 10
- [x] **PATH-04**: Integrate path validation into watcher.rs event filtering — ✅ Phase 10
- [x] **PATH-05**: Integrate path validation into scan.rs directory walking — ✅ Phase 10
- [x] **PATH-06**: Handle cross-platform path differences (Windows backslash, macOS case-insensitivity) — ✅ Phase 10

### Delete Operations Safety

- [x] **DELETE-01**: Wrap `delete_file_facts()` in row-count verification pattern (transaction not possible with sqlitegraph API) — ✅ Phase 12
- [x] **DELETE-02**: Add row-count assertions to verify all derived data is deleted — ✅ Phase 12
- [x] **DELETE-03**: Implement verification point tests for delete completeness — ✅ Phase 12
- [x] **DELETE-04**: Add invariant test: delete file → no dangling edges (orphan detection) — ✅ Phase 12

### SCIP Testing

- [x] **SCIP-01**: Export SCIP then parse to verify format correctness — ✅ Phase 13
- [x] **SCIP-02**: Add at least one integration test using scip crate parser — ✅ Phase 13 (7 tests pass)

### Documentation

- [x] **DOC-01**: Document .db location recommendations (place outside watched directory) — ✅ Phase 13
- [x] **DOC-02**: Update user documentation with security best practices — ✅ Phase 13

## v1.2 Requirements (Deferred)

### Performance & Caching

- **PERF-01**: Implement sqlitegraph caching for reference indexing (deferred to v1.2)
- **PERF-02**: Persist file index to avoid rebuilding (deferred to v1.2)

### Cross-File Accuracy

- **XREF-01**: Cross-file reference accuracy tests (deferred to v1.2)

### Gitignore Support

- **GIT-01**: Nested .gitignore file support (deferred to v1.2)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Semantic analysis / type checking | Magellan is "facts only" by design |
| LSP server / IDE language features | CLI-only tool |
| Async runtime / background thread pools | Keep deterministic + simple |
| Multi-root workspaces | v2 feature |
| LSIF export | Deprecated in favor of SCIP |
